1) change NODE_ENV to production
2) get new push notification certificates for production environment


Bugs:


Improvements:
1) In Notification.js, do not save firstName and lastName in an obj for each user. Just save the user._id,
and perform a fetch whenever you need to get a user's name. You'll have to fetch at most two users, which more than makes up for the save in db space.
2) Adjust user age everyday
2) Notify user when someone emotions their post
5) Notifications dont send to people who comment on someones post. Instead, they get sent to the person who's post it is
6) Add gender matching in soirees
7) make sure user is verified before posting/emotioning post
8) community distance filtering
9) create soirees per week
